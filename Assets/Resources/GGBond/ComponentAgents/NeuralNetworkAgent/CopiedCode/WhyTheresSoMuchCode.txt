So the reason why I had to copy all of this was because I was looking at a way
in which we could instantiate more than 2 neural networks and switch between them.

I figured I could use the already implemented code by MLAgents, but since so many
of the functions and fields were set to internal and couldn't be accessed, I decided 
just to copy all the reasoning behind those codes - which took me much longer than I thought.

I swear nothing cheaty is in any of those codes...
